- **NOTE:** Run all commands and queries across all your VMs (Dev, Stage and Prod)
    - Download the Splunk RPM installer package for Linux
    - Link: 
    ```bash
    wget -O splunk-9.1.1-64e843ea36b1.x86_64.rpm "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.1.1/linux/splunk-9.1.1-64e843ea36b1.x86_64.rpm"

    ```
    - Start the splunk server 
    ```bash
    sudo bash
    cd /opt/splunk/bin
    ./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes
    ```
- Enter administrator ``username`` and ``password``, remember this because you will need this to log into the application
- NOTE: The Password must be up to `8` characters. You can assign `adminadmin`
    ![SplunkSetup1!](https://github.com/awanmbandi/realworld-cicd-pipeline-project/raw/zdocs/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-28%20at%2010.48.24%20AM%20copy.png)

- Access your Splunk Installation at http://Splunk-Server-IP:8000 and log into splunk
    - Username: `admin`, Password: `Same Password You Just Configured Above`
    ![SplunkSetup2!](https://github.com/awanmbandi/realworld-cicd-pipeline-project/raw/zdocs/images/splunk-login-page.png)

- **NOTE(MANDATORY):** Once you login to the splunk Indexer
    - Click on `Settings` 
        - Click `Server Settings` 
        - Click `General Settings`
        - Go ahead and Change the `Pause indexing if free disk space` from `5000 to 50`

    - **NOTE:** If You Do Not Complete This Part Your Splunk Configuration Won't Work
    - **IMPORTANT:** Navigate Back to your `Terminal` where you're `Configuring the Indexer`
        - **Restart Splunk** (For those changes to be captured):  `./splunk restart`
        ![SplunkSetup4!](https://github.com/awanmbandi/realworld-cicd-pipeline-project/blob/zdocs/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-07-02%20at%209.50.16%20PM.png)
    - Refresh The Splunk Tab at http://Splunk-Server-IP:8000 and log back into splunk

#### Step 2: Install The Splunk Forwarder only on the `Dev, Stage and Prod` Servers
- **NOTE:** Execute every command mentioned bellow across all application servers in all the enviroments
- **NOTE:** Do Not install the Splunk Server in these resources/environments
- **SSH** Into your instances, as normal user `ec2-user` or ubuntu or centos etc

- Download the Splunk forwarder RPM installer package 
```bash
wget -O splunkforwarder-9.1.1-64e843ea36b1.x86_64.rpm "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.1.1/linux/splunkforwarder-9.1.1-64e843ea36b1.x86_64.rpm"
```
- Install the Forwarder
```bash
ls -al
sudo yum install ./splunkforwarder-9.1.1-64e843ea36b1.x86_64.rpm -y
```

- Change to the splunkforwarder bin directory and start the forwarder
- NOTE: The Password must be at least `8` characters long.
- Set the port for the forwarder to ``9997``, this is to keep splunk server from conflicting with the splunk forwarder
```bash
sudo bash
cd /opt/splunkforwarder/bin
./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes
```

- Set the forwarder to forward to the splunk server on port ``9997``, and will need to enter username and password (change IP address with your own server IP address). When prompted for username and password, enter what you set above for username and password.
```
./splunk add forward-server SPLUNK-SERVER-Public-IP-Address:9997
```

- Restart Splunk on the VM you are configuring the Forwarder
```
./splunk restart
```

- Set the forwarder to monitor the ``/var/log/tomcat/`` directory and restart
```
./splunk add monitor /var/log/tomcat/
```

2. Navigate Back to Your `Splunk Indexer/Server` 
- Set the port for the Splunk Indexer or Server to listen on 9997 and restart
```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
./splunk enable listen 9997
```
- Restart Splunk on the VM you are configuring the Forwarder
```
./splunk restart
```

#### Step 3: View Application Logs in Splunk
- Login to your `Splunk Server` at http://Splunk-Server-IP:8000
